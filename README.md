# From "Vibe Coder" to Software Engineer: A 1-Year Learning Journey

This interactive learning portal is designed for professionals transitioning into software engineering roles who need to build internal tools for their company. It provides a structured path to move from being a "vibe coder" (someone who uses AI tools to cobble together code without fully understanding it) to a confident software engineer who can architect, build, and maintain professional-grade applications.

## Overview: Your 1-Year Transformation Path

This learning portal is created for someone with self-taught programming experience in languages like Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript who wants to become a more effective contributor to their company's software engineering team. It provides a structured, hands-on approach that builds competence through practical projects focused on internal tools development.

### The Starting Point: "Vibe Coder"

- Currently using AI to generate code without fully understanding it
- Functioning more as a product manager who also handles some technical aspects
- Missing structured knowledge in modern web development frameworks and practices
- Needing a clear path to gain confidence and competence

### The End Goal: Effective Software Engineer

- Architect and build internal tools independently
- Understand code well enough to maintain and extend it without heavy AI reliance
- Make informed technology choices based on project requirements
- Effectively collaborate with other engineers using proper development practices

### Technology Track

The curriculum focuses on the following technology stack:

**Vue.js, C#, and SQLite**

- Great for Microsoft-centric environments
- Well-suited for internal enterprise tools
- Strong IDE support and established patterns

The portal itself will evolve as you progress through the curriculum, allowing you to apply what you learn by enhancing this very learning platform.

## Learning Philosophy & Approach

### Key Principles

- **Project-Based Learning**: Build real, usable internal tools while learning
- **Gradual AI Independence**: Start with AI assistance, gradually reduce reliance as you gain understanding
- **Balanced Theory & Practice**: Learn concepts then immediately apply them
- **Incremental Complexity**: Start simple, build to more complex architectures
- **Focus on Maintainable Code**: Emphasize writing code you can understand and maintain long-term

### Time Commitment

This plan is designed for someone working full-time who can dedicate:

- 5-10 hours per week to focused learning
- Ability to apply new skills in your actual work (critical for retention)
- Consistent effort over a 1-year period

## Features of This Learning Portal

- **Structured Learning Path**: Carefully sequenced modules progressively building your skills
- **Interactive Exercises**: Hands-on coding challenges relevant to internal tools development
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators showing your journey from beginner to competent engineer
- **Notes System**: Record insights and create your personal knowledge base

- **Features**: User authentication, cloud storage, API architecture
- **Your Role**: Implement backend, database, and deploy to production

## Expectations & Keys to Success

### What You Can Expect

- A clear, guided path from "vibe coder" to competent software engineer
- Hands-on exercises directly applicable to internal tools development
- A balance of theory and practical application
- Gradually decreasing reliance on AI coding assistants
- A comprehensive knowledge base you build as you learn

### What's Expected of You

- Consistent time investment (5-10 hours weekly)
- Application of concepts to real work projects
- Patience with the learning process (mastery takes time)
- Willingness to sometimes struggle through problems
- Gradual reduction in AI dependency as skills grow

## Getting Started

1. **Setup a Local Web Server** (necessary to avoid CORS issues):

   - Option 1: Use VSCode with Live Server extension
   - Option 2: Run `python -m http.server 8000` in the repository directory
   - Option 3: Use any other local web server solution

2. **Access the Portal**:

   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or whatever URL your server provides)
   - Click "Start Learning" to begin with the first module

3. **Track Your Progress**:
   - Your progress is saved automatically in your browser
   - Use the notes feature to document key insights
   - Export your progress periodically as a backup

No build steps or complex setup is required for this initial implementation.
